Lab 2: P4 Program Building Blocks with the PNA Architecture
===========================================================

This lab provides guidance to the process of building the P4 coding blocks 
compatible with the PNA architecture that will be compiled into a DPDK pipeline. 
In this lab, we will be implementing a simple application in which a packet is 
sent from a server and forwarded to the client.
